# Dissertation Project: Data-Driven Predictive Maintenance for Component Life-Cycle Extension

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data used for my dissertation project titled "Data-Driven Predictive Maintenance for Component Life-Cycle Extension". The repository founds itself in the master branch. The project focuses on applying various survival analysis models, such as Cox Proportional-Hazards, Random Survival Forest, Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis, and Survival Support Vector Machines, to predict the time to failure of machine components. It also contains the simulation code linked to run a stremlit app.

## Repository Structure
- **data**: Contains datasets used in the project.
- **code**: Contains Python scripts implementing the survival analysis models and data processing.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need Python 3.7 or higher. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
